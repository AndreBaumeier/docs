# Dropguard

Do you remember SA-CORE-2014-005? How does it feel to hear that Security Vulnerability name again? Bad memories? We hope not. But if, you should think about adding Drop Guard to your site.


Drupal Sites need to be kept secure, but
checking and upgrading Drupal can be
painfully a lengthy process. Drop Guard takes
over this hassle and makes the experience
painless. Drop Guard can work with any Git
Repository and is perfectly in-synch with
amazee.io. Secure Websites FTW.
