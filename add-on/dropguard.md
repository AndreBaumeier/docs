# Dropguard

Do you remember [SA-CORE-2014-005](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005)? How does it feel to hear the name of this security vulnerability name again? Bad memories? We hope not.

But if, you should think about adding [Drop Guard](https://www.drop-guard.net/) to your site. Drupal Sites need to be kept secure, but checking and upgrading Drupal can be a painful and lengthy process. Drop Guard takes over this hassle and makes the experience painless. Drop Guard can work with any Git Repository and is perfectly in-synch with amazee.io. Secure Websites FTW.
