# Going Live with amazee.io


## DNS
To make it as easy as possible for you to get your site pointing to our servers we have dedicated loadbalancer records. Those technical DNS resource records are used just for that.

Example: `<loadbalancer-name>.hosted.on.amazee.io`

We strongly suggest not to configure any static IP address in your DNS Zones. As amazee.io is a cloud hosting and our loadbalancer infrastructure can change over time which can have impact on your site availability.
