## GitHub / BitBucket

[GitHub](http://github.com) and [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) are we-based Git repository hosting services. Both of them are fully compatible with our automated deployment system.

The code of your Drupal website should be stored on one of those two hosters.


##SSH
SSH consists of two Keys:

- A **private key** which must be kept secret by the user at all times
- A **public key** stored on the amazee.io systems
