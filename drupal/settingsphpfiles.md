# Drupal Configuration - settings.php

We provide extended example settings files for all versions of Drupal and ways of installing Drupal on our GitHub Repository: https://github.com/amazeeio/drupal-setting-files.

Each file is fully documented, contains a lot of best practices and explanations.

If you like you can have your fully own way of handling the Drupal configuration and the settings files, please see our documentation of [Environment Variables](./environment_variables.md) to see a list of all existing environment variables.
