# Local Docker Development

amazee.io fully supports development work flows which involve local development sites. We provide a Docker development environment that runs on our local computer.
It uses the exact same configuration for **all** services. This means:
- If the site runs locally, it also runs on production
- You can use the exact same `settings.php` file for local and production

And the best: You don't need to have any amazee.io account or site running to use the local development environment! Just install it, and use all the power of amazee.io for free.
